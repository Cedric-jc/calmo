    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> <span class="effective-date">February 15, 2026</span> · <strong>Version:</strong> 2.0 (Community Features)</p>

    <section>
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Calmo - Warmly Connected ("we," "us," or "our") is a healing-focused social assistance app designed to help you navigate social conflicts with AI-powered suggestions. We are committed to a "Privacy-First" philosophy. This policy explains how we handle your information with maximum transparency and minimal data footprint. <strong>With the introduction of community features, you can now share experiences and support each other by posting public content—while keeping full control over your privacy.</strong></p>
    </section>

    <section class="highlight">
        <p><strong>Core Privacy Promise:</strong> We do not sell your data. You have full control: choose <strong>Local Mode</strong> to keep data only on your device, or <strong>Cloud Mode</strong> for secure backup and sync. We only process what is strictly necessary to provide our services. Your community posts are never used for advertising or AI training.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Information Collection & Processing</h2>
        <p>To provide our services, we process the following data based on your usage mode:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Information (Optional):</strong> If you create an account, we collect your email address and set up a secure authentication token. This allows you to log in across multiple devices and use community features.</li>
            <li><strong>User Inputs (Private):</strong> Text, voice, and images you provide for AI analysis—these are never shared with other users.</li>
            <li><strong>Community Posts (UGC):</strong> When you create posts, comments, or share media in our community section, this content is stored on our cloud servers and made visible to other users according to your sharing choices. <strong>You should never include sensitive personal information in public posts.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Data Storage Options:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Guest Mode:</strong> All data is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>. We do not have access to it, and it is lost if you uninstall the app. <em>Community posting is not available in Guest Mode.</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Logged-in Mode:</strong> Your conversation history, settings, <strong>and any community posts you create</strong> are <strong>encrypted and stored on our secure cloud servers</strong> to enable backup, sync, and community interaction.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>AI Processing:</strong> Private inputs are sent to our AI partners (e.g., OpenAI) solely for generating responses. <strong>We strictly prohibit our partners from using your data—private or public—to train their models.</strong></li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- NEW SECTION: Community & UGC -->
    <section>
        <h2>3. Community Content & Public Information</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Your Community, Your Choice:</strong> You decide what to share publicly. You can delete individual posts or all your community content at any time. We do not use your community posts for advertising, data mining, or AI training—and we never sell them.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Any information you voluntarily disclose in community areas (such as posts, comments, or your public profile) becomes publicly available to other users of Calmo. Please be mindful of your privacy and do not share sensitive personal data (e.g., address, phone number, financial information) that you are not comfortable disclosing.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ownership & License:</strong> You retain full ownership of your content. By posting, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to host, display, and distribute your content on Calmo solely for the purpose of operating the service. This license ends when you delete the content.</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion & Control:</strong> You can delete any of your posts or comments directly from the app. Upon deletion, content is immediately removed from public view and we will erase it from our servers within a reasonable time (typically within 30 days).</li>
            <li><strong>No AI Training Use:</strong> We do not use your public community posts to train AI models. Our AI partners are never granted access to community content for model training or any other non-service purpose.</li>
            <li><strong>Content Moderation:</strong> To maintain a safe and respectful environment, we may monitor or review community content for compliance with our Community Guidelines and applicable laws. We reserve the right to remove any content that violates these rules. When content is removed for violations, we notify the user and retain minimal records as required by law.</li>
            <li><strong>Interaction with Others:</strong> When you interact with other users’ posts (e.g., likes, replies), those interactions are also visible in the community and are governed by this policy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Note: Community features are only available when you are logged in and using Cloud Mode. If you switch to Guest Mode, your community posts will remain in the cloud until you delete them, but you won’t be able to create new posts or interact from that device.</em></p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. What We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        <p>We maintain a strict minimization policy—unchanged even with community features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Ad Tracking:</strong> We do not collect IDFA or Advertising IDs. Community content is never used for ad profiling.</li>
            <li><strong>No Precise Location:</strong> We do not track your GPS location. Any location mentioned in posts is voluntarily provided by you.</li>
            <li><strong>No Sale of Data:</strong> We never sell your personal information or conversation content—public or private—to third parties.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Encryption Everywhere:</strong> Data is encrypted in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest (AES-256) on our servers for logged-in users—this includes all community posts.</li>
            <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Our employees are strictly prohibited from accessing your private conversation content. Access to community content is limited to moderation and support teams solely for safety and legal compliance.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Your Rights and Control</h2>
        <p>You have full control over your data—including community content:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access & Export:</strong> You can view or export your private conversations and community posts at any time via Settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Manage Community Posts:</strong> You can edit or delete individual posts/comments directly from the community feed. Bulk deletion is available in your profile settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Delete Account:</strong> You can delete your account via Settings. This will permanently erase your personal info, all cloud data—including all community posts—from our servers. Some content may remain in cached backups for up to 30 days before full erasure.</li>
            <li><strong>Switch Modes:</strong> You can log out to switch to Guest Mode (cloud data including posts will no longer sync, but remains available when you log back in).</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We only share your private inputs with AI infrastructure providers necessary to generate responses—they are contractually forbidden from using data for training. <strong>Your public posts are shared with other Calmo users as an inherent part of the community feature; this is a service functionality, not a third-party disclosure.</strong> We do not partner with advertisers, data brokers, or marketing analytics firms. No third party receives your community content for commercial purposes.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Calmo - Warmly Connected is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children. If you are a minor, please use this service only under the supervision of a guardian. <strong>If you believe a child under 13 has posted content in our community, please contact us immediately—we will promptly remove the content and delete associated data.</strong></p>
